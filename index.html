    <h1>Aging Demographic Chloropleth Map</h1>
    <!-- div to hold the graph -->
     <p> Like most developed countries, Australia's population is ageing as a result of sustained low fertility and increasing life expectancy. This has resulted in proportionally fewer children (under 15 years of age) in the population and a larger proportion of people aged 65 and over. </p>

    <h2>Life Expectancy</h2>
    <p> Life expectancy is the number of years a newborn is expected to live for. Factors such as health care access, lifestyle habits, and socioeconmic status can impact life expectancy. From 2000 to 2021, life expectancy has increased by 3.41 years from 79.7 years in 2000 to 83.1 years in 2021.</p>
    <div id="life_expectancy">
    </div>

    <p>There are twice as many women as men aged 85 years and over, reflecting their longer life expectancy. It is estimated that the number of Australians aged 85 and over will increase from 400,000 in 2010 to 1.8 million by 2050.</p>
